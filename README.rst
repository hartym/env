Romain Dorgueil's unix environment
==================================

This is not intended to be useable by anyone except me. If you find usefull
stuff in there, pick everything, crush it, hack it, sell it, do whatever you
want. It's even more free than free beer.

This repo is a shortcut for me to install my unix env on my different boxes. It
should be at least useable on debian (etch/lenny/squeeze), ubuntu (lucid) and
macosx (maybe requires some specific ports installed. macosx is not the
platform I'm using the most).

Usage
=====

* ``make``: will generate dynamic directories.
* ``make install``: will *DESTROY* your actual user's environment and put this
  one instead. *You've been warned.*
